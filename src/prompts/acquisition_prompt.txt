Generate a complete Official and Professional “Residential Acquisition” Document for the specified target property in LaTeX format using the provided template exactly as written.
Your output must be the full, compile-ready LaTeX document with no commentary or explanation outside the code block.
Perform a deep property data search using publicly available sources (Zillow, Realtor, Redfin, etc.) to accurately populate all fields.
Maintain a professional, data-driven, and analytical tone as if written by a real estate acquisitions analyst preparing an investor memorandum.
Do not include any placeholder artifacts such as .∗?.*?.∗?{index=\d+} in your output.
Objective
{
Your goal is to justify a lower purchase price by presenting credible, data-supported analysis that demonstrates the property is overvalued or can be acquired below the distressed-market floor.
All comparable data and narrative must reinforce negotiation leverage in favor of a discounted acquisition.
}
Variable Definitions
 {
 Target Address: { 15 Ann St, Pottsville, PA 17901 },
 Target Acquisition Price: { $20,000 - $25,000 max },
 Earnest Deposit: { $500 },
 Inspection/Closing Period (days): { 30 },
 Parcel ID: { TBD },
// For all other property variables (type, size, taxes, condition, year built, etc.),
// gather accurate details via deep property data lookup from public sources such as Zillow, Realtor, or Redfin.
 }
Acquisition Comps Selection Logic (Strict Rules)
{
Find 3–4 comparable single-family or row homes sold within the past 18–24 months and within a 5–15 mile radius of the subject.
Comps must meet all of the following:
Be in similar or worse condition (distressed, fixer-upper, “as-is”).
Be equal to or cheaper than the Target Acquisition Price (≤ $17,000).
If no cheaper comps exist, include only the closest-in-condition ones, and clearly explain that their higher price reinforces the negotiation case.
}
Explicit Rules:
{
Exclude luxury, turnkey, or fully renovated comps that skew prices upward.
Omit any comp exceeding the target price by more than 25%.
Prefer listings labeled “needs work,” “investor special,” “as-is,” or “cash only.”
Ensure all comp commentary supports a downward value adjustment and highlights value-add potential.
}
Narrative Requirements
{
In the written sections:
Clearly conclude that comparable properties are trading at or below the target price.
State that the subject should be acquired for an amount equal to or less than the current offer.
Emphasize distress factors, market liquidity risk, and repair costs as key drivers for valuation reduction.
Maintain factual precision and concise financial reasoning throughout.
}

LaTeX Safety Rules:
{
Do not use inline math mode ($...$) for approximate symbols, units, or numbers.
Use \textasciitilde instead of $\sim$ for “approximately.”
All \item commands must appear only inside proper list environments (itemize, enumerate, etc.), and never inside math mode.
Ensure all math environments ($ or \[) are properly opened and closed on the same line.
Ensure all indentation and whitespace uses only the standard ASCII space character ($\text{U+0020}$). Do not use any Unicode non-breaking spaces or thin spaces for alignment.
}

Final Output Requirement:
{ 
Deliver the complete, ready-to-compile LaTeX document only, following the provided template exactly.
No explanations, summaries, or commentary should appear outside or inside the LaTeX code block, and absolutely no references or citations should appear in the output. I need a latex code block as the output.
Use the LaTeX template below exactly as written.
Populate all placeholders with real property and comp data according to the rules above.
Ensure all comparables and market commentary *support negotiation leverage* by demonstrating that the subject is overvalued or can be acquired below market.
Include no text outside the LaTeX code block. Always follow latex rules such as ‘\&’ instead of ‘&’

\noindent\textbf{Property Overview}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Type:} [\# Beds / \# Baths — Property Type (e.g., Townhouse, Detached, etc.)]
  \item \textbf{Size:} $\sim$[Square Footage] sq ft \quad | \quad Built [Year Built]
  \item \textbf{Construction:} [Roof Type / Exterior Type] \quad | \quad [\# of Levels] Levels
  \item \textbf{Annual Taxes:} \$[Tax Amount]
  \item \textbf{Condition:} [Brief description of current condition and major issues]
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.4cm}

\section*{Market Context \& Actual Value Floor}
Recent floor comparables for similar distressed [Property Type]s in [City or Neighborhood] typically sell between \textbf{\$[Low Range]–\$[High Range]}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {}[Comparable 1 Address] — \textbf{\$[Price 1]}
  \item {}[Comparable 2 Address] — \textbf{\$[Price 2]}
  \item {}[Comparable 3 Address] — \textbf{\$[Price 3]}
\end{itemize}

These figures reflect true market-clearing values for semi-distressed cash properties. Based on [subject property's] condition, \textbf{its fair market value likely sits within or below this range}.

\vspace{0.4cm}

\section*{Specific Risk Items}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Heating System:} [Condition and estimated cost if known]
  \item \textbf{Electrical System:} [Condition and estimated cost if known]
  \item \textbf{Plumbing / Service Panel:} [Condition and estimated cost if known]
  \item \textbf{Windows / Roof:} [Condition and estimated lifespan]
  \item \textbf{Liquidity Risk:} [Description of resale or financing limitations]
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.4cm}

\section*{Acquisition Framework}
\textbf{Target Offer Range:} \$[Low Offer]–\$[High Offer]\\
\textbf{Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO):} \textbf{\$[MAO Amount]}

\vspace{0.4cm}

\section*{Contract Structure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Offer \textbf{As-Is}; seller makes no repairs.
  \item Include \textbf{assignability clause} for wholesale disposition.
  \item \textbf{Inspection period:} [\# of days, e.g., 14 business days].
  \item \textbf{Closing:} [\# of days, e.g., 30 days] post-clear title (cash basis).
  \item \textbf{Earnest Money:} \$[Earnest Deposit].
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\section*{Comparable Sales (As-Is Floor)}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X c c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Address} & \textbf{Beds/Baths} & \textbf{Sale Price} & \textbf{Sale Date}\\
\midrule
{[Comparable 1 Address]} & [Beds/Baths 1] & \$[Price 1] & [Date 1]\\
{[Comparable 2 Address]} & [Beds/Baths 2] & \$[Price 2] & [Date 2]\\
{[Comparable 3 Address]} & [Beds/Baths 3] & \$[Price 3] & [Date 3]\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\vspace{0.3cm}

These comparables confirm the \textbf{\$[Low Range]–\$[High Range]} as-is valuation band. Subject property’s [specific issue] warrants trading at or below this floor.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\section*{Conclusion \& Action Plan}
[Property Address or Name] is a \textbf{[brief summary of condition]} asset located in a [description of neighborhood or market]. Its current state makes it suitable for [assignment / fix-and-hold / rental] strategies.
